# Familiar Faces

Mobile application that assists in recognizing actors that you have seen in previous movies or tv shows.
The application interacts with a free REST API, [TMDB](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction)

All data is currently only stored on the phone's hard drive. Since this is not published, it is doubtful I will go through the trouble of setting up user accounts/remote storage.
